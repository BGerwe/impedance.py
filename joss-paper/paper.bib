	abstract = {An equation for the impedance of a macrohomogeneous porous electrode is derived for the general case (finite electrode thickness and resistivities of the solid and liquid phases), and it is shown how to obtain from it the general solution for the transient state. The electrode model is represented by a transmission line equivalent circuit, and the theory is further generalized by including an arbitrary time delay (a hindrance) of the charge transfer process at the pore surface. A reformulation leads to the definition of an appropriate dielectric function. Two hindrance processes are considered, namely control of the charge transfer by finite diffusion and control by both diffusion and formation of a pseudocapacity (ie charge storage) on a molecular scale. The resulting impedance characteristics for selected parameter values are discussed and preliminary results of fitting experimental data with the new theory are presented.},

	abstract = {A method is presented of avoiding ambiguities in linear Kramers-Kronig validity tests due to under- and over-fitting. It is based on the observation that the parameters of the equivalent circuit model to be fitted start degenerating as soon as the model order chosen is too high and over-fitting is taking place. Hence, a measure of the degree of degeneration is introduced and from this a criterion is developed with which over-fitting can be easily detected. Furthermore, it is shown, how the developed criterion can be used to automatically find an appropriate model order for any given impedance spectrum. Hereby, unambiguous test results are obtained irrespective of the specific expertise of the operator. Due to its ease of use the so improved test can serve as a quick standard test revealing defectiveness of measured impedance spectra. The validity of the proposed strategy is demonstrated in simulations as well as on measurements of a commercial Lithium-Ion battery.},
